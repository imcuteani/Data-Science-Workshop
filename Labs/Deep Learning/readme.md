# Deep Learning

This folder contains several series of hands-on labs designed to introduce tools and libraries for building intelligent apps that leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Each subfolder contains one series of hands-on labs and has a number in the name (200, 300, or 400) that represents the level of technical detail in the series, with 400 being the most advanced. Each series consists of four hands-on labs that build on one another and follow this pattern:

- Ingest - Gather data
- Process - Prepare or clean the data for use in machine learning
- Predict - Train and score a machine-learning model
- Visualize - Visualize the output from the model

To work a series of labs, start with the first lab in the series, then proceed to the second, the third, and the fourth, in that order. Depending on the technical level, a series generally requires 1 to 2 hours to work from start to finish.

Lab Series | Scenario | Technology/Language | Cost
---------- | -------- | ------------------- | -
[200 - Machine Learning in Python](./200%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20in%20Python) | Create a Data Science Virtual Machine DSVM), import a dataset containing on-time arrival information for a major U.S. airline, and use scikit-learn to build a machine-learning model that predicts whether flights will arrive on time. | [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview)<br>[Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)<br>[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)<br>Python | [$$](../Costs.md)
[300 - Neural Networks with CNTK](./300%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20with%20CNTK) | Use the [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to train a neural network built with the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit and Azure Machine Learning Workbench to recognize handwritten digits. Then deploy the model and write a Node.js app to visualize the output. | [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/cognitive-toolkit/)<br>[Azure Machine Learning Workbench](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/quickstart-installation)<br>Python and JavaScript | [$$](../Costs.md)
[400 - Image Classification with MMLSpark](./400%20-%20Image%20Classification%20with%20MMLSpark) | Use Bing Image Search to create a database of famous paintings. Then train a deep neural network (DNN) to recognize the artists of those paintings and write a Node.js app that uses the DNN to examine uploaded images and identify the artists. | [MMLSpark](https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark)<br>[Azure Machine Learning Workbench](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/quickstart-installation)<br>[Bing Image Search API](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/bing-image-search-api/)<br>[Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/)<br>Python and JavaScript | [$$](../Costs.md)
[400 - Stream Analytics and Machine Learning](./400%20-%20Stream%20Analytics%20and%20Machine%20Learning) | Build an end-to-end system that examines photos taken by simulated cameras in the Arctic and identifies those containing pictures of polar bears. Then use Power BI to build a real-time dashboard showing where polar bears are being spotted. | [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/)<br>[Azure Machine Learning Workbench](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/preview/quickstart-installation)<br>[Custom Vision Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/)<br>[Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/)<br>[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)<br>Python and JavaScript | [$$](../Costs.md)
